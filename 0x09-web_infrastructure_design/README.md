# 0x09. Web infrastructure design

This directory contains files generated during the web design infrastructure
lesson of the LAX Software Engineering program. This project involves designing
web infrastructure, from simple 1 server stacks to more complicated and secure ones.

The following scripts are included, and contain links to my web infrastructure:

- 0-simple_web_stack: a simple web infrastructure composed of a single server with a LAMP stack
- 1-distributed_web_infrastructure: a three server web infrastructure
- 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure: a three server web infrastructure with firewalls, SSL certification, etc
- 3-scale_up: a three server web infrastructure with 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one
