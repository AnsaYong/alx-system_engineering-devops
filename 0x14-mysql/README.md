# 0x14. MySQL

This directory contains bash scripts generated during the MySQL server setup lesson of the

the main server and creating/setting up a replica of the database in another server.

The following scripts are included:

- 4-mysql_configuration_primary: MySQL primary configuration.
- 4-mysql_configuration_replica: MySQL replica configuration.
- 5-mysql_backup: a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.
