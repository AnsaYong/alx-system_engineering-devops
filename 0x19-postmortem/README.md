Postmortem: Service Outage on February 17, 2024

Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (UTC-5).
Impact: The outage affected the ChatGPT service, rendering it unavailable to approximately 75% of users. Users attempting to access the service during this period experienced timeouts or errors.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer, leading to an imbalance in traffic distribution and subsequent service degradation.
Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating a significant increase in error rates.
10:05 AM: Engineers began investigating the issue, initially focusing on the application servers and database clusters for potential issues.
10:15 AM: Assumptions were made that the issue might be related to a sudden spike in traffic or a potential DDoS attack.
10:25 AM: Further investigation revealed no abnormalities in traffic patterns or signs of malicious activity.
10:30 AM: The investigation shifted towards the load balancer configuration, suspecting a possible misconfiguration.
10:45 AM: It was discovered that the load balancer was indeed misconfigured, causing uneven distribution of traffic and overloading certain servers.
10:50 AM: The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for immediate resolution.
11:00 AM: The misconfiguration was corrected, and the load balancer was reconfigured to evenly distribute traffic across servers.
11:30 AM: Service was fully restored, and users were able to access ChatGPT without any further issues.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the load balancer, leading to an uneven distribution of traffic and subsequent service degradation.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration to evenly distribute traffic across servers.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement stricter configuration management processes to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to quickly detect and respond to load balancer issues.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of all load balancer configurations to ensure they adhere to best practices.
Implement automated checks to validate load balancer configurations against known issues.
Enhance load balancer monitoring to detect and alert on misconfigurations in real-time.
Conclusion:
The outage on February 17, 2024, was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer, resulting in service degradation for approximately 75% of users. The issue was promptly identified and resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration. To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will implement stricter configuration management processes and enhance monitoring capabilities.
