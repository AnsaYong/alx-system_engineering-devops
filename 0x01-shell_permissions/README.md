This directory contains scrits written for the shell permissions project at alx.
In these projects, I created the following Bash scripts to automate permissions while working with Bash.
The list of scripts created include:

-0-iam-betty: switches current user to betty
-1-who-am-i: prints the effective username of the current user
-2-groups: prints all the groups the current user is part of
-3-new-owner: changes the owner of the file hello to the user betty
-4-empty: creates an empty file called hello
-5-execute: adds execute permission to the owner of the file hello
-6-multiple-permissions: adds execute permission to the owner and the group owner, and read permission to other users, to the file hello
-7-everybody: adds execution permission to the owner, the group owner and the other users, to the file hello
-8-james-bond: to the file hello no permissions for owner and group and all permissions for other users
-9-john-doe: sets the mode of the file hello
-10-mirror-permission: sets the mode of the file hello the same as ollehâ€™s mode
-11-directories-permissions: adds execute permission to all subdirectories of the current directory for the owner, the group owner and all other users
-12-directory-permissions: creates a directory called my-dir with permissions 751 in the working directory
-13-change-group: changes the group owner to school for the file hello
